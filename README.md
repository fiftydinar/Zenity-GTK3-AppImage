# Zenity-adw-gtk3-AppImage
Unofficial AppImage of Zenity **GTK3 Version** with bundled `adw-gtk3` theme

It supports dark mode, although, it doesn't transition on theme changes when app is running.

Modified it a bit for personal usage, all credits belong to @Samueru-sama who built Zenity GTK3 AppImage.

**raison d'Ãªtre:** 

GTK4 version is higher in filesize & harder to build, so I just use what already exists & spice it up.

---------------------------------------------------------------

AppImage made using [sharun](https://github.com/VHSgunzo/sharun), which makes it extremely easy to turn any binary into a portable package without using containers or similar tricks.

**This AppImage bundles everything and should work on any linux distro, even on musl based ones.**
